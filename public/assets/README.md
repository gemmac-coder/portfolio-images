## React JS Portfolio

## Description

I have built this React JS Portfolio to showcase my web development work and my React JS skills.
Take a look through to see what I have been working on and how my full-stack development skills have flourished during the University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp.

## What did I do

- Used the ReactDom to render my App
- Created About, Header, Main and Projects Components to be rendered on the ReactDom
- Used functional and class components
- Used the useState and useEffect hooks and axios to fetch my Github repo data
- Used the map function to map through the array of repos from Github and render a project card for each
- Used props to render the repo name and html URL link for each of these project cards
